- Studio
  - User account information will not be linked to the studio in any way. Bridget will enter all information about students and their contact(s).
  - As indicated by the previous bullet, there's no such thing as "parents". Instead there are "student contacts"â€”the people who can be contacted about a student
     (and in the case of an adult student, they will be their own student contact)
  - Bridget can create an account for a new parent (or adult student) with studio access, and they receive an email that prompts them to set a password.
    - But this doesn't create a record in the `students` or `student_contacts` tables (see the first bullet). It only creates a record in the `users` table.
  - If an existing user needs studio access, Bridget can search for them by email and grant it.
- Teaching Resources
  - Each resource is a separate page, and can be purchased individually:
    - How to start a studio
    - How to hold a successful recital
    - Videos of Bridget teaching a student for a year
      - The first lesson in the series could be free
      - Maybe 40 lessons total
    - Printable resources
